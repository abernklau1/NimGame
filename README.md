## Overview
This is a program developed in C++ to test what we as a team have learned over the spring semester of 2023 at RRCC in Computer Science I. The NimGame is a marble game played by a user and the computer. A pile of marbles is randomly generated between 10 and 100. Each player takes turns pulling marbles from the pile and the one who pulls the final marble loses. The program randomly determines who goes first, the user or the computer. After, the program then chooses randomly whether the computer is smart or dumb. The difference between the intellectual levels of the computer determines whether the computer will pull a random amount between 1 and half the pile size or enough to return a pile size equal to $2^n - 1$.
